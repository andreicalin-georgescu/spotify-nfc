## README for Spotify-NFC-Player

This repo is inspired by  Michael Hawkins' How to control Spotify on Amazon Echo
Dot" video tutorial. The video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMtRH-3sTR4.

The code source has been updated to use a new form for the play API call.

It will soon make use of the Arduino JSON parsing library and will have new features
added to it.

This code is provided as is. No liability is taken in case of any damage.
